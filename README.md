  Fully client-side with state management using the `useState` hook.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** Framework for React with server-side rendering and static generation.

## Code Overview

### **State Management:**

- **Adding Tasks:**  
  Uses the `submitHandler` function to append a task (containing title and description) to the state `maintask`.

  ```javascript
  const submitHandler = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setMainTask([...maintask, { title, desc }]);
    settitle("");
    setdesc("");
  };
